## Context

In the visa processing system, I need a robust and clear methed to represent the architecture struccture which includes classes, attributed and methods also the relationships between classes. An accessible and open visual representation is essential for both the development team and myself.

## Decison

I've made the decision to use the class diagram as the main technique for representing architectural design.

## Rationale

Class diagram is essential part of the UML, the industry-standard modelling language used in software engineering, which is why I chose them. Class diagram is crucial for object-oriented analysis and design will give us an overview of the system architecture.

## Implications

Positive: Acts like a development roadmap, guaranteeing team unity.

Negative: Class diagrams can quickly become out of date if they are not properly maintained, which can lead to errors with the actual coding.
