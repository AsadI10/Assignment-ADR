## Context

The context diagram shows the intercation that is between differect actors in the visa system such as: Visa, Applicant, Regional Administrator, Visa Consultant Officer, Data Protection officer, Advisee and the manager, also including the user interface. The context diagram shows the system boundries and the relationsip between the users and their roles in the overall process.

## Decison

I've Decided to use the context diagram layout to showcase the interactions and boubdries within the visa application system.

## Rationale

The decision is driveen by the need:
1.Role and responsabilities and interactions, should be made clear.
2.Define the outside interface and system boundries.
3.Understanding the system data flow between the actors. 4. Points for security and data protetction recognitions.

## Implications

The followung are the efects of this choice:
1.Clear instructions for UI design that take into account the various actors.
2.Provided levels of access control for every actor in order to preserve system security
