## Context

To make sure that the development efforts are aligned with the user needs, I need to require a format to recor dfunctional requirements from the viewpoint of end users.

## Decison

I've made decision to use user stories to explain the specification of my system for processign visas.

## Rationale

The user stories will allow me to capture the functionality of the system in a user centric way, which will enable to help our development team to understand value and prioritize work accordingly.

## Implications

Positive side, this will result in a well-organised backlog of taksas with an emphasis on providing value to users. Writing effective user stories, however it requires an in depth knowledge of the users which can take time to do it.

## Status

Accepted and created user stories
