## Context

In order to effectively present the relationship between different data entities, I need an easy to understand visualization of our database design

## Decison

I have decided that I will be using Entity-Relationship-Diagram(ERD) for our database design process.

## Rationale

I choose ERDs because they offer clear representation that will mkae it easier for me and the stakeholders to quikcly undertand the relationship and structure of the database

## Implications

Positive: Better communication and the undertanding of the database design will result from this. The drawback is that regular updates will be necessary to maintain the ERD's position with the database as it changes.
