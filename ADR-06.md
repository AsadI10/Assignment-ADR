## Context

I have to carefully record the architecture of our system, making sure that it is clear at different levels of abstraction.

## Decison

I've decided to use the C4 model to draw container diagram to show the architecture of my system.

## Rationale

The ordered design of C4 model, in my opinion, will make it easier for me to explein the vatuous tiers of our system architecture, from high-level structures to particular code components

## Implications

The primary benefit lies in the improvements of our architectural communication with team memebers who are not technical as well as those who are.

## Status

Accepted and designed the C4 Model
