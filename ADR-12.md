## Decision

I've decided to implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. Design the system modularity and maintanability

## Rationale

Data protection requires secure authetincation. Scaling and miantencance are made easier with a modular system.

## Implications

The system should and must be able to handle sentitive data securely, follow to privacy laws and be robust to scale if demand increase.
